TabScore provides wireless scoring for the card game bridge.

It is a web application that uses Windows 10 and IIS to serve web pages across a local wireless LAN.  Hence it just requires a browser on the tablets.  It uses the standard Bridgemate .bws standard Access database, so is a direct replacement for BridgeTab (or Bridgemate, BridgePad etc).

There is a TabScore website at: https://tabscore.infinityfreeapp.com/, where there are further information and downloads available. 

TabScore was developed uisng Microsoft Visual Studio.  It is written in C# using MVC.  The web pages use Bootstrap for formatting, and some basic Javascript and JQuery.  The installer projects use Wix.
