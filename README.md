TabScore provides wireless scoring for the card game bridge.
It is a web application written in C# and MVC that uses IIS to serve web pages across a local wireless LAN.  Hence it just requires a browser on the tablets.  It uses the standard Bridgemate .bws standard Access database, so is a direct replacement for BridgeTab (or Bridgemate, BridgePad etc).
